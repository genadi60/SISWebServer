        <strong><em>Cake</em></strong> is a form of <strong><em>sweet dessert</em></strong> that is typically baked.
        In its oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads,
        but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that
        can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with
        other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
